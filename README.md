# "Baby-sitters Club" As Data
Data, tutorials, etc. related to a computational text analysis of the "Baby-sitters Club" series.

## Current ideas
* Topic modeling: what is common across all the books? How can we identify clusters of "special topic" books?
* Voice: do the characters each have their own distinct voice? Does the author/ghostwriter situation influence it? Looking particularly for sentiment and Mary Anne, reading level and Claudia, active verbs and Kristy, slang and Stacey
* Sequence alignment: do they actually copy and paste text (especially tropes) between novels?
* Stylometry: what differentiates the writing of Ann M. Martin & her ghostwriters?
* Word vectors: which characters/names are most similar to one another using word vectors? (e.g. how does "Claud" act differently than "Claudia"?)
* Sentiment analysis: how does this track for each of the books, and align (or not) with Ann M. Martin's papers
* Fanfic: looking at character pairings, especially slashfic
* Creative: re-training OpenAI to write BSC novels
* Other: looking at the function of parentheticals (background explanation? snarky commentary?)
